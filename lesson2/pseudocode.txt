a function that returns the sum of two numbers

informal
//create a function that receives two nubmer arguments
//return the result of adding the two arguments values

formal
//START
//SET variable 'add' to the value of a function that receives two number arguments
  //PRINT the result of adding the two arguments 
//END


a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. 
For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should 
return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x'). If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, 
return null.

Informal
create a function that receives a target character and a string.
  -initialize a counter variable to the number zero.
  -loop through the string
    -on each iteration check if the value of the current character is equal to the target character
    -if it is, 
      -incriment the counter variable
      -Check if the counter variable is equal to 3. if it is,
        - return the current string character index for this iteration of the loop
  -if the counter variable is < 3 after looping through the whole string, return Null
