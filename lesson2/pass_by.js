/* 4
    logs Hello Goodbye aray from inside the function, then the mutated array

*/

/* 5
    logs hello goodbye array from inside the function, then logs the new array
    Hi Goodbye on line 8. Or maybe it logs an error due to two smemi colons? 
    
    WRONG 
    
    the reassignment to a new array that happens in the function only effects the
    inner parameter variable words, it does not mutate the array passed in.
